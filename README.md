Flat Buttons
===========

The button classes can be used with a Storyboard by setting the color of the text and the background 
to color the styles provided by these button classes which inherit `UIButton` and override the `drawrect` 
method.

## Usage

These button classes can be copied into your project or referenced as a submodule with 
just the button classes being referenced in your project. To use them set the Custom Class
in your Storyboard or Xib to one of these button classes and set the text and background
color and experiment with the options until you find a design which works for you. The
screenshot below shows how these buttons appear in iOS 6 and 7.

The files to use are in the `FlatButtons` folder with a sample project in the `Example` folder.
